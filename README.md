# asset_consent_miniproject
In “ASSET CONSENT” the First important think view is to implement in
3D or reality modeling, not only speeds up the design process but also enables
architects and designers play around with different ideas and identify potential design
problems before they become actual issues. 3D modeling in construction, by putting all
the pieces together, provides a real-view of the finished project.
And second most important, we implemented is Soil tests for construction of
buildings or any structure is the first step in construction planning to understand the
suitability of soil for proposed construction work.
Soil which is responsible for allowing the stresses coming from the structure
should be well tested to give excellent performance. If soil shouldn’t tested correctly
then the whole building or structure is damaged or collapsed or leaned like leaning
tower of Pisa. So, soil inspection or testing is the first step to proceed any construction.
